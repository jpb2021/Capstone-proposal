    "The cost benefit analysis of a photovoltaic (PV) installation requires the knowledge of both the type of solar panels used and the weather conditions on site. In effect, the value of the electricity generated over the life span of an installation must exceed the cost of its deployment. \n",
    "\n",
    "To undertake such a study, it is necessary to have at hand weather data, such as irradiation, ambient temperature and the typical weather patterns present on the site. Also necessary, is to have access to the PV arrayâ€™s performance data such as the power generated for given weather conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To facilitate such studies, the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) in the USA has installed three fully instrumented photovoltaic arrays as well as an ancillary weather station on its Gaithersburg (MD) campus. The data recorded between August 2014 and July 2017 is freely available on the NIST web site. \n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this project is to use the machine learning technique taught in the course on the NIST data. More precisely, it is envisaged to create a model that links the power generated to the wheatear data from the metrological station. It will then be possible to predict the energy generated over a given time period for known weather conditions.\n",

    "The data supplied by NIST is well organised, but in it its present form it is not suitable for analysis. The main problem is that the data is spread over 1500 spreadsheets, each corresponding to one physical location and one calendar day. The first task will be the merging of all these data into a database so that the relevant data can then be easily extracted into DataFrames suitable for analysis. A second problem is the high time resolution of the data as well as the duration over which (four years) the data have been collected. It is unlikely that all these data will fit in a PC â€˜s memory nor that it can be processed in a reasonable amount of time. This call for multiple analysis over shorter time intervals. This will be greatly facilitated by the use of a database.\n",

The clean-up consists in the search for missing data, verification of the continuity of the time-series as well a search for non-valid data format. It is expected that the data be of high quality as the NIST system is fully automatic, but no assumption is made at this stage. It is essential, that the data clean-up can be fully automated."

    "The experience I gained so far into this course, is that familiarisation with data is an essential ingredient for the proper use of the various models used throughout the course.

Therefore, at this stage, I believe that before some â€˜wrestlingâ€™ with the data has been done, it is difficult to respond how the EDA will inform my project plan.
